This is the first post in what will hopefully become a series. For this project I wanted to see how far I could get with a kaggle dataset in under four hours. Because the topic interested me, I dove into Kaggle's [animal shelter](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes) dataset.
<br><br>
For this dataset, kaggle asks that you predict which dogs and cats will have each of five outcomes: Adoption, Died, Euthanasia, Return to Owner, and Transfer. Potential predictors include Animal Type (dog versus cat), breed, color, sex, and age.
